As the year draws to a close, the holiday period offers a natural moment to pause, reflect, and reset before stepping into what comes next. It’s a time when routines slow down, priorities shift, and attention turns toward the people and moments that matter most.

Wherever you are and however you choose to spend this season, I hope it brings a sense of calm, connection, and perspective. Time shared with family, friends, and those you value can be a welcome reminder of what grounds us, especially after a year shaped by constant change and motion.

Looking ahead, 2026 carries its own set of opportunities and unknowns. I hope it is a year marked by steady progress, good health, meaningful work, and the confidence to embrace new challenges. A safe and prosperous year is built not only on ambition, but on balance, curiosity, and care for one another.

Thank you for taking the time to read and be here. Warm wishes for the holiday season, and all the best as you move into the year ahead.
