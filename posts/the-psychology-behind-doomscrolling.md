Doomscrolling is the habit of continuously consuming negative or distressing news and content online, often for extended periods, even when it causes anxiety, sadness, or a sense of helplessness. It typically involves scrolling through social media feeds, news apps, or forums late into the night or during quiet moments, moving from one troubling headline to the next without a clear stopping point. The term emerged relatively recently, but the behaviour itself has become widespread alongside always-connected devices and infinite scrolling interfaces.

A large portion of people engage in doomscrolling, whether they recognise it or not. Studies and surveys conducted during periods of global uncertainty, such as pandemics, economic instability, or geopolitical conflict, have shown sharp increases in time spent consuming negative news. Many people report checking updates dozens of times a day, often without gaining new information. While the exact percentage varies by region and platform, doomscrolling has become common enough to be considered a modern behavioural pattern rather than an isolated habit.

The psychology behind doomscrolling is complex. Humans are naturally wired to pay attention to threats, a survival mechanism that once helped us avoid danger. Negative information feels urgent and important, triggering a desire to stay informed. At the same time, uncertainty creates discomfort, and scrolling promises relief through clarity or resolution. Unfortunately, that resolution rarely arrives. Instead, each new piece of information reinforces the cycle, keeping the brain in a heightened state of alertness.

Doomscrolling persists even when people feel uneasy because it creates a false sense of control. Staying informed can feel like preparation, as though awareness alone might reduce risk. In reality, repeated exposure to distressing content often increases stress without improving understanding or agency. The brain becomes stuck between fear and curiosity, seeking reassurance but finding more reasons to keep scrolling.

Platforms play a significant role in reinforcing this behaviour. Many digital services are designed to maximise engagement, measured by time spent, clicks, and interactions. Algorithms prioritise content that provokes strong emotional responses, because such content keeps users active longer. Negative or alarming posts often outperform neutral ones, leading platforms to surface more of them. Infinite scrolling, autoplay, and push notifications remove natural stopping points, making it easy to lose track of time.

A large proportion of modern platforms are explicitly optimised for attention capture. Design choices are tested and refined to keep users engaged, sometimes without regard for emotional impact. This does not mean every platform intentionally promotes distress, but it does mean that systems reward content that holds attention, regardless of whether that attention is healthy. Doomscrolling thrives in environments where urgency and novelty are constantly reinforced.

Recognising doomscrolling in others can be subtle. It may show up as compulsive phone checking, difficulty disengaging from news discussions, irritability, or persistent anxiety about events beyond one’s control. People may repeatedly bring up alarming topics or struggle to focus on conversations that are not related to what they have been reading online. These behaviours are often dismissed as being “informed,” when they may actually signal emotional overload.

Preventing doomscrolling starts with awareness. Setting boundaries around when and how news is consumed can make a significant difference. Limiting exposure to specific times of day, disabling non-essential notifications, and choosing trusted sources over endless feeds helps reduce compulsive checking. Replacing passive scrolling with intentional reading encourages deeper understanding rather than surface-level anxiety.

Helping others avoid doomscrolling involves empathy rather than confrontation. Encouraging breaks, suggesting alternative activities, or simply acknowledging shared uncertainty can reduce the need to seek constant updates. Creating spaces for offline connection, physical movement, and creative engagement provides natural counterbalances to digital overload.

In conclusion, doomscrolling is a byproduct of human psychology interacting with attention-driven technology. It reflects a desire to feel informed and prepared in uncertain times, even when that desire leads to discomfort. Addressing it requires both personal intention and broader awareness of how digital environments shape behaviour. By recognising the pattern and reclaiming control over how we consume information, it becomes possible to stay informed without becoming overwhelmed, and to engage with the world in a more balanced and sustainable way.
