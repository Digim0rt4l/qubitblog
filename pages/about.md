My interest in technology is deeply rooted in family influence and early exposure, shaped long before I ever wrote a line of code or configured my first system.

My grandfather played a pivotal role in sparking that curiosity. During the war, he served as a Morse code radio communications officer — a role he rarely spoke about, but one that quietly defined his lifelong relationship with technology. Outside of his service, he maintained a broad and hands-on interest in technical pursuits, ranging from radio communications and classic automobiles to early personal computers and cellular telephones. For someone of his generation, his productivity and comfort with emerging technology were remarkable.

Spending time with him offered more than just stories — it provided practical insight. Through him, I was introduced to radio receivers, and two-way communication equipment, and I learned how technology could be both functional and fascinating. Those experiences left a lasting impression, and to this day, my interest in radio receivers and two-way radios can be traced directly back to that relationship.

My father further reinforced this foundation. He maintained a strong academic and professional interest in computing, minoring in computer science during university before going on to become the lead developer at a nearby hospital. There, he worked on critical admissions and discharge systems, leading a small team of developers and applying technology in environments where reliability and precision mattered.

Growing up, technology was always present in our household. My father kept pace with emerging hardware and platforms, often owning the latest Apple laptops and cutting-edge mobile devices of the time. That constant exposure naturally encouraged curiosity, experimentation, and an appreciation for both the practical and creative sides of technology.

As a millennial, I was fortunate to grow up during a period of rapid and formative technological change. I experienced the transition from dial-up to broadband internet, the rise of person-to-person file sharing, early instant messaging platforms like MSN Messenger, the emergence of Linux as a viable operating system, and the evolution of gaming from a niche hobby into a connected, global experience. I witnessed the early stages of connected technology and watched it mature into the deeply integrated digital ecosystem we rely on today.

That progression — from analog signals and standalone devices to always-connected systems — has been both fascinating and formative. It has shaped how I think about technology, not just as tools, but as systems that influence how we communicate, work, and interact with the world.

This blog exists as a way to document and share that journey. It’s a space where I reflect on what I’ve learned, explore current technologies, and offer perspectives that encourage thought and discussion. Along the way, I’ll occasionally share industry news, personal observations, and stories that connect past experiences with present innovations.

Technology continues to evolve, and so does our understanding of it. This blog is my contribution to that ongoing conversation.
